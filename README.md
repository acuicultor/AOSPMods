**Compatibility:**
This module is designed based on AOSP source code. What does it mean? it means that it's expected to work on Roms (Firmwares) which are built based on fairly unmodified Android source code. This means, mainly, Pixel Phones (3, 4, 4a, 5, 5a, 6), and any other Roms that haven't heavily modified the original Android codes. Our feedbacks show that AOSPMods is compatible with Pixel stock Roms and Pixel Experience (normal edition). The mod can also be installed on ArrowOS, Pixel Experience (Plus Edition), ProtonAOSP and LineageOS with *some* broken features.

- Android 12:         Compatible
- Android 12.1 (12L): Compatible
- Andriod 12.1 beta:  Compatible
- Android 13:         NOT Compatible


**Prerequisits:**
- Compatible Roms (see above)
- Device Rooted by Magisk 24.2+
- LSPosed (Zygisk Version)


**How to install:**
- Install the magisk module
- Reboot (bootloops are not expected)
- You can use AOSPMods app to configure the module
